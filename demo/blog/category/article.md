## styling

~~should be stroke~~ lorem uspum lorem uspum lorem uspum lorem uspum lorem uspum
 
**should be bold** __should be bold too__ 
*should be italic* _and this one itaclic too_
***bold and italic*** and ___this one bold and italic too___

## Emphasis (more styling)

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~
 
## Links

There are two ways to create links.

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com

## Images

Here's our logo (hover to see the title text):

Inline-style: 
![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1")

Reference-style: 
![alt text][logo]

[logo]: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 2"

## table

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less | Pretty |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *Still* | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1 | 2 | 3 |

## takslists (showdown only)

- [x] This task is done
- [ ] This is still pending

## Blockquotes

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. 

## regular html test

<p>paragraph about nothingparagraph about nothing paragraph about nothing paragraph about nothing paragraph about nothing </p> 
<p>second paragraph about nothingparagraph about nothing paragraph about nothing paragraph about nothing paragraph about nothing </p>

<h3>html heading</h3>
<pre>
{
    comment: 'some preformatted code block'
}
</pre>

## Youtube videos
   
They can't be added directly but you can add an image with a link to the video like this:

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=fO2u-uxVBIc
" target="_blank"><img src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/fO2u-uxVBIc/mqdefault.webp" 
alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>


Or, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border:

[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/oJkeWbM6WCc/mqdefault.webp)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fO2u-uxVBIc)
